# C++ Strings
My own implementation of the string class in C++.
To use the string class, you need to load `String.h` and `String.cpp `, then add it to your main folder/directory.
Include the string using the command `#include "String.h"` in your main file.
Compile your file using String.cpp using `g++ String.cpp yourfile.cpp -o output file` in bash.
Run the `output file' using the command "./output file" in bash.

To use a class, you need to use the namespace N.
